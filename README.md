## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Database Structure

The system uses localStorage to simulate a database with the following structure:

#### Users Database (`users_db`)
```javascript
{
  "email@example.com": {
    id: "user_001",
    email: "email@example.com",
    password: "hashed_password",
    name: "User Name",
    phone: "+1234567890",
    role: "user",
    dateRegistered: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    preferences: {
      favorites: [],
      searchHistory: []
    }
  }
}
```

#### Admin Database (`admin_db`)
```javascript
{
  "admin@eliterealty.com": {
    id: "admin_001",
    email: "admin@eliterealty.com",
    password: "hashed_password",
    name: "Admin User",
    role: "admin",
    adminCode: "ELITE2024",
    permissions: ["read", "write", "delete", "manage_properties"],
    dateCreated: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

#### Properties Database (`properties_db`)
```javascript
[
  {
    id: "prop_001",
    title: "Property Title",
    location: "City, State",
    price: 750000,
    type: "house",
    beds: 4,
    baths: 3,

    agent: "Agent Name",
    agentPhone: "+1-555-0123"
  }
]
```

### Session Management
- Sessions are stored in `active_sessions` localStorage key
